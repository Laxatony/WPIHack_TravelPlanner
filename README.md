## 2.Project Motivation
Have you ever plan a trip on your own? After having a plenty of spots on your must-go list, now you have to make a good arrangement of them. 
Coming up with an appropriate schedule kills a person; a couple may even have several arguments before everything settled.
First of all, spot information, transport information, trip routes and other details are often documented in text. It takes a person a lot copy/past
manipulations to rearrange spots. Second, information may be stored in different type of files, such as having details 
in doc extension and having routes in google map application. All these issues make the trip a terrible start. 
For these reasons, we want to create a survice that makes trip arrangement more easily.

## 3.Project Description
The project is built using HTML, Javascript and Google Map API. The funtionality is described in [Funtionality] section.
